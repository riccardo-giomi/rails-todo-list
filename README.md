# Rails TODO list

A Ruby on Rails 7.1 application that allows to create TODO notes and show them
in a list.

This is a simple exercise in Hotwire and StimilusJS, starting from a "normal"
Rails application created with my
[quickstart template](https://github.com/riccardo-giomi/rails-7.1-quickstart).
